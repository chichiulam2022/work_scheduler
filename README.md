# Work Scheduler

https://chichiulam2022.github.io/work_scheduler/

This work scheduler app was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JQuery. It allows you to create and save your routine schedule from 8 am to 8 pm. It also indicates the current time using Moment.js API. There are three colours for this app to show if your schedule is present (red), past (grey), and future (green).
